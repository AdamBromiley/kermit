# Serious-Cryptography

A collection of cryptography-related programs inspired by the book *Serious Cryptography - A Practical Introduction to Modern Encryption*, Jean-Philippe Aumasson (ISBN-13: 978-1-59327-826-7). No code (unless otherwise stated) is copied from the book; this project is merely a demonstration of the knowledge I have learnt from it.

The repository structure vaguely mimics the order of the book's chapters.

## Usage
Each program is stand-alone and, generally, they are compiled with `make` and cleaned up with `make clean` from their respective root directories. Specific usage instructions, though, are provided in the README.md file in their roots.

Programs may make use of the shared libraries located in `lib/`. This will be evident from the programs' header or Make files, and will be noted in their README.md.
