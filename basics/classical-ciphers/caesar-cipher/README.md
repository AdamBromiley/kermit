# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is the simplest of substitution ciphers where every letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed amount down the alphabet. Deciphering is simply done by performing the same shift but the other way down the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case where the shift amount is 13, meaning (because the basic alphabet has 26 letters) it is its own inverse.
